/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This second step is where it is determined what the exact needs and expectations for the software. This is where customers, &/or just the team themselves, can say 'We need a button to display a picture of a monkey to the user, and  it needs to be done within 10 seconds of them pressing that button.' This is also where it is learned what OS, hardware, and other programs the 'in development and yet to be created' need to be able to access or send data to."
const design = "This third step is where program and database begins to be thought out. This is also where mockups of the program are created so both the developers and customer know what the program should look like. There should be at least notes, if not notes and a presentation, on to how everything will function together by the end. This is to be aproved by the end user/customer/dev team. This is also where the nitty gritty things are decided like what programming language should be used"
const implementation = "Step four, CODING TIME! This is where the developers start creating the code with all the information they've gathered from the previous steps. About every two weeks you take a part, or everything you've created so far, to the customer/end user/team to get feedback."
const testingAndIntegration = "Step five is where the new program is tested to make sure that the functionality of the developed program is up to the requirements given. This is where possibly hidden bugs are found and it might be sent back to the development team with things to fix."
const maintain = "Once this new program is deployed, it now needs to be maintained so that way if an OS is updated or anything else changes the program will still work."
